## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **License overrides no longer unlock paid tiers in shipped builds.** `postgresExplorer.license.enforcement=off` and a custom `postgresExplorer.license.endpoint` are ignored unless the extension is running in the Extension Development Host. Both keys were removed from the contributed settings manifest. Leftover user values are ignored and do not throw. Fail-open-to-free and the 7-day offline grace window are unchanged: a network failure never grants a paid tier and never locks out a cached paid tier inside that window.

> Unpublished. These notes were drafted on 2026-08-15 as 2.5.1. That version is not on the Marketplace, Open VSX, or a git tag. The current stable release is 2.4.0. Its published nightly is 2.5.0.

### ⚡ Query execution & cancel

- **Stop / Cancel** — Notebook stop, TopBar cancel, and `postgres-explorer.cancelQuery` now cancel the active backend via PostgreSQL wire cancel (`CancelRequest`) with `pg_cancel_backend` fallback; in-flight state is shared across notebook kernels.
- **Sliding-window guardrails** — Scalar/volatile `SELECT`s (`pg_sleep`, advisory locks, etc.) and queries without `FROM` no longer enter the server-side cursor path, so cancel is not blocked by nested `COUNT` wrappers or cursor `FETCH`.

### ⌨️ Keyboard & commands

- **Keybindings** — Run advance, run to here, cancel query, switch database, query history, saved queries, and full-dataset toggle; `Ctrl+Shift+B` / `Ctrl+Shift+O` scoped so they no longer fire outside NexQL notebooks.
- **Command palette** — Uncategorized commands assigned to categories for faster discovery.

### 📓 Notebooks & SQL workflow

- **Query history** — Pin entries, search, Quick Pick launcher, and a pinned section in the history tree.
- **Saved queries** — Search matches SQL and tags; open paths route through the notebook editor.
- **Named cells** — `@cell` references with temp-table materialization across cells.
- **Declared parameters** — `-- @param` block parsing; optional rewrite-on-prompt gated by `postgresExplorer.parameters.rewriteCellOnPrompt` (default off).
- **Cell metadata** — `lastRun` and NexQL cell metadata round-trip through the notebook serializer.

### 📊 Results & export

- **Result grid** — `Ctrl+C` cell copy, context-menu filter / exclude / add-to-WHERE, and FK “show referencing rows”.
- **Excel export** — Available from the result export menu (alongside CSV/JSON).

### 🤖 Pro (when `packages/pro` is linked)

- **DbIndex autocomplete** — Semantic/schema index hits surface in SQL completion via the `CompletionCandidateSource` seam (Sponsor gate).

### Fixed

- **Import path** — `DbIndexCompletionSource` pro typecheck resolves core modules correctly (`../../../../../src/…`).

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-08

> Published nightly of stable [2.4.0](#240---2026-08-08). Marketplace pre-release `2.5.0` and Open VSX package `postgres-explorer-nightly` `2.5.0`. This is not the `package.json` version. Nightlies are computed from the even stable version (`2.4.0` → `2.5.0`).

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-08

### 🤖 NexQL Bot rebrand

- **SQL Assistant → NexQL Bot** — Commands, activity bar view, settings keys, and chat UI copy renamed across the extension; deprecated SQL Assistant icon removed.

### 🔌 MCP server & agent configuration

- **Settings hub MCP panel** — Tool profile picker (`meta` / `query` / `dba` / `full`), resolved binary path/source display, and restart-required banner when the ephemeral profile changes.
- **One-click install** — Preferences opens a terminal with `npm install -g nexql-mcp` or `cargo install nexql-mcp`; npm is recommended on all platforms.
- **PATH re-probe** — After a global install, **Detect** / **Re-check installed version** refreshes the shell PATH and re-resolves the binary without a window reload.
- **Update checks** — Manual **Check for update** compares the installed `nexql-mcp` against the latest npm release; update banner offers npm, cargo, or a copy-paste GitHub Releases curl snippet for air-gapped installs.
- **Core MCP API** — `checkForUpdate()`, `latestVersion` / `updateAvailable` on server status, launch descriptors, and connection invalidation hooks for pro builds.

### 🧠 Agentic AI controls

- **`postgresExplorer.ai.agenticMaxSteps`** — Configurable cap on tool-loop steps per NexQL Bot run (default 20, max 100); oldest history is trimmed first when context is tight.
- **Settings hub** — Agentic step limit exposed in Preferences with inline description.

### 📝 Notebooks & query generation

- **Generate Query** — Database picker when the selected connection exposes multiple databases; connection + database context is passed through to NexQL Bot.
- **Scratch notebooks** — Name-keyed scratch paths with legacy connection-id fallback; reopening scratch for a different connection/database opens a fresh notebook instead of silently reusing the wrong one.
- **Metadata repair** — Scratch notebooks missing connection metadata get backfilled on open.

### 📖 Documentation

- **README & MARKETPLACE** — Restructured for clearer product positioning and onboarding.

### 🛠️ Build & packaging

- **Pro type-check** — `tsconfig.pro.typecheck.json` and Makefile target for type-checking the pro build seam.
- **`.vscodeignore`** — Runtime dependencies (onnxruntime, sharp, sqlite3, etc.) included correctly in packaged VSIX builds.
- **Template loader** — Shared CSS prepend and optional `chat-actions.js` injection for pro webview templates.

### Fixed

- **GitHub sign-in on focus (Fixes #132)** — Usage backend seam extended so unsigned users never trigger session resolution during status-bar refresh.
- **Single-connection notebook guess** — SqlExecutor no longer persists a lone configured connection onto notebooks that lack connection metadata (opt-in fallback only).

---

## [2.2.3] - 2026-07-29

### 🔌 MCP Server — stdio Cutover

- **Bundled Binary Spawn** — The MCP integration now registers a VS Code stdio definition that spawns the standalone `nexql-mcp` binary instead of exposing a local HTTP endpoint.
- **Binary Path Override** — `postgresExplorer.mcp.binaryPath` can override the resolved binary for debugging or custom packaging, and the Preferences panel shows the resolved path/source.
- **SSH Connections Skipped** — SSH-tunneled connections are omitted from the ephemeral MCP profile and named in the Preferences panel rather than failing opaquely.
- **TLS Profile Support** — Ephemeral profiles now emit `sslmode`, `sslcert`, `sslkey`, and `sslrootcert` for managed Postgres (Neon, Supabase, RDS).

### Fixed

- **Repeated GitHub sign-in prompt on focus (Fixes #132)** — Status-bar usage refresh no longer schedules auth work for unsigned users; GitHub model catalog probes only when the GitHub provider is active; all GitHub session access goes through a single silent-by-default helper.

---

## [2.2.2] - 2026-07-17
> Nightly releases -  v2.3.1 • v2.3.2

### 🖱️ Drag & Drop into Chat and Notebooks

- **Drag DB Objects from the Explorer** — Drag tables, views, columns, functions/procedures/aggregates (with argument signatures), and more from the database tree straight into the SQL Assistant composer as `@mentions`, or drop onto a `.pgsql` cell/editor to insert a formatted reference.
- **Drag Notebooks & Saved Queries** — Drag a `.pgsql` notebook or a saved query from their tree views into chat; the assistant pulls in the notebook's SQL cells or the saved query text as context automatically.
- **Attach Notebooks/Saved Queries via @mention** — The `@` mention picker now lists your notebooks and saved queries alongside schema objects.

### 🔐 Safer NexQL Free AI Sign-In. Issue #124 | Discussion #123
> Thanks to the community for reporting and helping us improve the sign-in experience.

- **Actionable Sign-In Banner** — A dismissible banner appears in the SQL Assistant when the free model is selected and you're not signed in, with **Sign in** and **Choose provider** actions.
- **Clearer Auth Errors** — Failed NexQL Free AI requests due to a missing/expired session now surface a specific "sign in or switch provider" message instead of a generic failure.

### 🔌 MCP Server — Fixed Port & Token

- **Persistent Bearer Token** — The MCP server's auth token is now stored in VS Code `SecretStorage` and reused across extension host restarts, instead of regenerating randomly every launch.
- **Configurable Fixed Port** — New `postgresExplorer.mcp.port` setting (also exposed as a **Fixed port** field in **NexQL Settings → Preferences**) lets external clients (Cursor, Antigravity, Codex, etc.) hard-code the MCP endpoint. `0` (default) keeps the previous random-port behavior. Changing the port from the Preferences panel restarts the running server immediately — no window reload needed.

### 🗄️ Database Indexing Enhancements & Redesign

- **In-Webview Indexing Wizard Modal** — Replaced the multi-step VS Code QuickPick setup wizard with a beautiful, fully integrated modal dialog matching the connection editor's styling. 
- **Auto-Rebuild of Stale Indexes** — Silent background auto-rebuild of database indexes that are more than 1 week (7 days) old to prevent metadata staleness.
- **Connection-Grouped Compact View** — Redesigned the index status dashboard in both the Settings Hub and the dedicated Database Index Grounding panels. Active indexes are now neatly grouped under their parent connections.

### Fixed

- **Empty Result Tables** — Queries that return columns but zero rows now render the table header with a centered "No data" hint instead of collapsing to a generic empty state.
- **Cursor Count Query Timeout Scope** — Row-count timeout for windowed cursor fetches now uses session-scoped `statement_timeout` instead of `SET LOCAL`, fixing cases where the timeout silently didn't apply outside an explicit transaction.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-09

### 🚀 NexQL AI Models — Generally Available

NexQL Free AI is now **Generally Available** — a zero-configuration AI assistant powered by managed models behind a secure gateway proxy. No API keys, no provider accounts, no setup. Just connect a database and start chatting.
This is a major milestone for NexQL as it allows us to offer a free and open-source AI assistant with a freemium model that allows users to get more work done with no/low cost.

> **Note:** The NexQL AI gateway is in Beta and may be subject to change in the future depending on usage patterns and demands.

- **Tier-Gated Model Aliases** — Three AI tiers exposed:
  - 🧠 **Smart** (free tier) — daily-use AI for queries, explanations, and schema help. ~600K tokens/month.
  - 🔧 **Engineer** (Sponsor · $2/month) — advanced model for complex optimization and migrations. ~3M tokens/month (~5× free).
  - 🏗️ **Architect** (Singularity · $9/month) — the best AI for database engineering. ~10M tokens/month (~16× free).
- **Zero-Config Onboarding** — `nexql-free` autoloads as the default AI provider. Open the SQL Assistant and start asking questions immediately — no API key or account configuration needed.
- **Accurate Usage Displays** — Real-time token usage tracking surfaced in the status bar tooltip, license quick-pick, and Settings → License panel. Cache is invalidated after every request so counts stay current.
- **Atomic Monthly Quota** — Server-side atomic quota reservation via `reserveUsage`/`refundUsage` eliminates TOCTOU race conditions. Only delivered, non-empty replies count toward your monthly limit.
- **Per-Tier Throttling** — Per-account and per-IP fixed-window rate limiting atop the monthly cap prevents abuse while keeping the service responsive for all users.
- **Client-Disconnect Abort** — Disconnecting mid-stream aborts the upstream gateway request, stopping token accumulation immediately.

### 🔌 MCP Server Integration

NexQL now ships a built-in **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that exposes your connected PostgreSQL databases as live-indexed tools — directly consumable by Copilot, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any other MCP-compatible AI agent.

- **In-Process Streamable HTTP Server** — No SDK dependency; a hand-rolled JSON-RPC-over-HTTP server binds to a random local port on demand, authenticates via a per-session bearer token, and serves all of NexQL's read-only database tools under the MCP protocol.
- **VS Code Native Registration** — Registers automatically with VS Code's MCP registry (`vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider`) so Copilot and other VS Code LM clients discover NexQL databases instantly without manual config.
- **Configurable via Settings Hub** — Enable/disable the MCP server, view the active port and bearer token, and toggle auto-start from the **NexQL Settings → Preferences** panel.
- **Database Tools Exposed over MCP** — All the same read-only tools the in-chat agentic loop uses are now accessible to external agents:
  - `list_schemas`, `list_objects`, `describe_object` — schema discovery
  - `search_schema` — full-text search over table and column names
  - `run_select` — safe read-only SQL execution (SELECT/EXPLAIN only)
  - `explain_query` — EXPLAIN ANALYZE plan retrieval
  - `get_join_path` — automatic foreign-key relationship traversal
  - `get_table_stats`, `get_index_usage` — performance analytics
  - `switch_connection` — context switching between connections
- **Schema Grounding Instructions** — MCP `initialize` response includes instructions that tell external agents to always ground SQL in the live schema before writing any queries — preventing hallucinated table names.
- **Session Management** — Up to 32 concurrent MCP sessions with a 30-minute idle TTL and automatic sweep.
- **Rate Limiting** — Built-in 200 requests/minute cap on the MCP server endpoint to prevent runaway agent loops.

### Unlimited Access — Previously Gated Features

The following features are now **100% unlimited and free** across all subscription tiers:

- **Data Import** — Import CSV/JSON data into tables with no usage cap.
- **Backup & Restore** — Full database backup and restore workflows are now unrestricted.
- **Database Indexing** — Building, auto-indexing, multi-database indexing, and semantic (local-embedding) indexing are all now free.

### Added

- **Non-Streaming Request Support** — Gateway and client now honor the `req.body.stream` flag. Non-streaming requests buffer upstream SSE chunks and return a single aggregated, OpenAI-compatible JSON response.
- **Collapsible Inline Thinking Steps** — The SQL Assistant's agentic trace now renders as a clean vertical timeline. Individual steps with detail content (tool call results, reasoning, retrieved context) are collapsible with a rotating chevron.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-06-30
> Nightly releases -  v2.0.1 • v2.1.0 • v2.1.1 • v2.1.2 • v2.1.3 • v2.1.4 • v2.1.5 

### Added

- **Connection-Level Query History & Saved Queries** — Implemented connection-specific tracking of query history and saved queries under the database explorer tree.

### Refactored

- **Complete Rebranding to NexQL** — Refactored all remaining references, email templates, database schemas, assets, documentation, and website links to point to the new NexQL branding instead of PgStudio.

### Enhanced

- **Connection-Specific Tree Refreshes** — Refactored tree provider to perform connection-specific or item-specific refreshes instead of full tree refreshes when connecting or disconnecting.
- **Catalog Query Batching** — Optimized SQL autocomplete catalog loading by batching metadata queries, reducing connection roundtrips and UI lag.
- **Autocomplete Optimization** — Cached constructed completion item lists on the schema cache to avoid O(N) allocation overhead on every keystroke in large databases.
- **Instant Schema Tree Invalidation** — Automatically invalidates the explorer schema cache and refreshes the database sidebar immediately when catalog-invalidating DDL queries are executed.
- **Cursor Count Timeout** — Applied a 1000ms `statement_timeout` to nested cursor row count queries to prevent connection hangs on tables with millions of records.
- **Schema Poller Backoff** — Implemented an exponential poll-interval backoff (up to 5 minutes) when no schema fingerprint changes are detected to save database and network resources.
- **Schema Cache Capping** — Capped the local schema cache size to 1500 entries to prevent memory leaks during long-running sessions.

### Fixed

- **Column Deduplication in Query Results** — Automatically deduplicates duplicate column names in query results (e.g., duplicate select columns or expressions) by appending a count suffix like `(1)`, `(2)`, etc.
- **Nameless/Empty Columns Mapping** — Maps nameless/empty columns to `?column?` and deduplicates them accordingly to avoid key collisions.
- **Query & Cursor Array-Mode Execution** — Reconfigured database query execution and cursor result fetching to use array row-mode, ensuring row values map correctly to the deduplicated columns without data loss or key collision issues.

### Removed

- **Unused settings** — Removed duplicate configurations `streaming.enabled` and `streaming.batchSize`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **AI Credentials & Model Catalog Services** — Added `AiCredentialsService` and `AiModelCatalogService` to securely manage per-provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) independently in secret storage.
- **Granular AI Configuration Scoping** — Split configuration settings between `ai.chat.*` (for sidebar chat assistant) and `ai.notebook.*` (for inline CodeLens/insights query assistant).
- **Active Model Picker UI** — Redesigned Chat UI panel with a header-based active model picker dropdown, dynamic capabilities, and custom AI settings page launcher.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-02

- *Maintenance version bump; adjusted VS Code dependency to 1.105.0.*

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-02
> Nightly releases — v1.3.10 • v1.3.11 • v1.3.15 • v1.5.0

### Added

- **Full dataset toggle** — Switch result cells between preview and full dataset rendering.
- **Smarter AI assistant** — Task-specific prompts (fix, optimize, explain, analyze, generate); `@mention` schema ranked to your question with per-object caps; configurable context budget (`postgresExplorer.ai.maxContextTokens`, default 8000); self-check against provided schema to reduce invented columns.
- **Sampled data analysis** — Large result sets analyzed from the first 200 rows with a `(sampled X of Y rows)` note.
- **Per-provider AI API keys** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and custom keys are stored separately in Secret Storage; switching providers in AI Settings restores each key.
- **Scoped AI configuration** — `postgresExplorer.ai.chat.*` vs `postgresExplorer.ai.notebook.*` for SQL Assistant chat vs notebook/dashboard/saved-query AI (CodeLens **Ask AI** uses the notebook scope).
- **Chat model picker** — Header dropdown lists models from all configured providers; **Configure AI…** opens AI Settings.

### Changed

- **Notebook toolbar** — Updated cell commands, labels, and icons for the query workflow.
- **AI quick-actions** — Optimize/explain use an attached plan directly instead of asking you to re-run `EXPLAIN`; schema fetches are faster and retry on failure.
- **Default AI models** — OpenAI `gpt-4.1`, Anthropic `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash` (override via scoped `ai.chat.model` / `ai.notebook.model` or legacy `postgresExplorer.aiModel`).
- **AI Settings** — “Configure for” scope selector (chat vs notebook); saving persists all provider key fields without overwriting other providers; VS Code LM model list stores model **id** (display name in the label).

### Fixed

- **Dashboard AI Insights** — Ask AI opens the sidebar reliably; metric brain icons and in-panel quick-actions/Send append messages and call the assistant; close/backdrop no longer block dashboard clicks (body-level panel, no transform hit-testing).
- **VS Code LM model selection** — Notebook/CodeLens/dashboard AI no longer silently falls back to the first available model (e.g. Haiku) when the saved display string did not match; resolves by model id and errors if the configured model is missing.
- **Dashboard WAL tab** — Restored replication table rendering after AI query-result code was merged into `updateWalReplication` (fixed load-time error that broke dashboard script init).

---

## [1.2.9] - 2026-05-23
> Nightly releases - v1.3.11

### Added

- **Parameter comment completions** — Typing `--` in a SQL cell with `$1`/`:name` params now suggests missing `-- $1=` / `-- :name=` definitions. A Quick Fix action inserts all missing stubs at once.
  - Example: 
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1 AND status = :status
    ```
    triggers suggestions for:
    ```sql
    -- $1=
    -- :status=
    ```
- **Production safety banner** — Connection form shows a warning banner when environment is Production, prompting you to enable read-only mode. 
  - **Environment tagging** is now clearer and more reliable, with badges on connection cards and a status bar indicator for active Production connections.
  - **Query safety analyzer** now applies a Production risk multiplier to better catch dangerous queries and require confirmation.
  - **Status bar risk indicator** now shows a warning icon whenever a Production connection is active.

### Changed

- SSL connections tagged as Production no longer silently downgrade to plaintext.
- Explain Analyzer, Schema Designer, AI Assistant, and Saved Queries now route through Pro feature gates with freemium counters. 
- Freemium model is 100% functional with clear upgrade paths, and Pro features are fully unlocked in development builds (coming soon).

---

## [1.2.7] - 2026-05-13
> Nightly releases - v1.3.9 • v1.3.10

### Added

- **Role Designer** — Added a new visual role-management editor from the role context menu, with live SQL preview, notebook handoff, and membership controls for Inherit / Admin Option grants.
- **Notebook parameter bank** — SQL parameter prompts now remember values per notebook, offer quick-pick reuse, and let you clear saved values without affecting other notebooks.
- **Streaming row counts** — Sliding-window result rendering now shows the total row count when it is available, so streamed results read as `start–end of total` instead of only a range.

### Changed

- **SQL completion catalog** — Column completion warm-cache queries now read from PostgreSQL catalogs directly, which improves coverage for views and materialized views.
- **Result cursor metadata** — Cursor window messages now carry optional total-row metadata through the renderer path.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-05-07
> Nightly releases - v1.3.6 • v1.3.7 

### Added

- **Plan Studio** — Added a dedicated workspace for deep `EXPLAIN` analysis with plan comparison, flame graphs, and performance recommendations.
- **Schema designer ERD import/export** — Added DBML import, multi-schema ERD support, and export/migration draft helpers.
- **Query result renderer upgrades** — Added lazy-loaded chart, analyst, and explain tabs, plus a more modular renderer pipeline for query results.

### Changed

- **Telemetry and status UX** — Added explicit telemetry mode controls and a status-bar indicator, with message handling updates across the extension.
- **Dashboard and saved queries** — Refreshed dashboard rendering and saved-query flows to match the new message/result model.
- **Connection and AI settings** — Updated the connection form, AI settings panel, and chat webviews to support the new workflows.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-05-03
> Nightly releases - v1.3.3 • v1.3.4 • v1.3.5

### Added

- **Backup and restore** — Database backup and restore from the extension: connection/database selection, a dedicated backup/restore webview with guided options, `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` (and related) argument builders with safe identifier handling and extra CLI args parsing, task-provider integration for scheduled dumps from VS Code, and clearer logging and errors across the flow. Chat assistant gains backup-oriented tooling and prompts where relevant.
- **PostgreSQL server version awareness** — New server-version helper so the extension can adapt queries and metadata reads; SQL helpers and the database tree use the live server version for better behavior on PostgreSQL 10 and 11. SQL completions and the DDL viewer incorporate version-aware paths where capabilities differ by release.

### Changed

- **Database commands** — Refactored database command surface to align with the new backup/restore entry points and shared resolution of connections for external tools.
- **Chat webview** — Wiring updates to support backup-related assistant flows alongside existing chat behavior.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- **Multi-statement failure strategies** — Added `postgresExplorer.query.executionFailureStrategy` so long SQL batches can keep going, stop hard, or ask you what to do next.
- **Execution summaries** — Mixed results now end with a clear markdown recap, so you can see what succeeded, what failed, and how far the cell got without digging through noise.
- **Dangerous SQL transaction UX** — Risky SQL now asks once per cell and gives you a safer `Execute in Transaction` path with an explicit COMMIT/ROLLBACK follow-up.
- **Result AI toolbar** — The result actions are easier to find now: a proper toggle reveals the strip when you need it, and **Add to chat** sends the query, sample rows, and helpful context without extra clicking.
- **Telemetry modes** — Choose between no telemetry, basic usage counters, or detailed performance buckets. It stays behind VS Code's global telemetry switch and is surfaced where you can actually change it.
  - Dashboard: WAL/checkpointer/version-safe stats; unused-index severity; statement stats if extension present.
  - Connection test/save: TCP preflight; SSL cert paths for verify modes.
  - Webviews: typed message IDs + validation; shared panel CSS; chat CSP nonce.
  - Saved-query import: counts + merge by id/title; CI triggers documented; tree item keys; What’s New `command:` URIs.
- **SQL completion warm cache** — Completions can reuse a warm cache tied to notebook metadata, with invalidation when the tree or executed SQL updates schema-related context.
- **ERD 2.0 across schemas & DBML import** — Schema designer adds commands to open an ERD spanning multiple schemas and to import DBML for visualization and workflow (DBML parsing via `@dbml/core`).
- **Lazy result tabs** — Chart, analyst, and explain experiences load on demand in the notebook result renderer to keep heavy UI off the critical path.

### Changed
- **Improved SQL keyword suggestions**: Notebook SQL suggestions now pay attention to where you are in the query, so the list feels less random and more helpful.
- Query analysis now explains ALTER impact more clearly and asks for confirmation more consistently when a change could hurt production.
- Telemetry now uses explicit modes and sinks, with lifecycle, usage, and optional performance events routed more intentionally.
- Connections no longer silently relax SSL in production, and AI providers are kept on an allowlist with a guard for empty messages.
- Grid preferences now return structured responses, coverage merges happen before reporting, and `.cursor/` is ignored.
- **SQL completion depth** — Parser support for stripping comments and normalizing identifiers; completions respect `search_path`-changing statements, derived subquery aliases, and session metadata; shared completion helpers consolidated.
- **Schema designer / ERD** — ERD panel and webview reorganized into focused modules (queries, types, HTML, DBML import, export/migration draft helpers); AI settings/chat templates updated alongside AI service wiring.
- **Notebook result renderer** — Chart.js registration is idempotent; large result rendering split into dedicated modules (`renderQueryResult`, review/edit helpers) for clearer structure and easier maintenance.

### Fixed
- Explorer favorites key typo (trailing space).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Sliding-window result streaming**: Large `SELECT` results can now stream in windows instead of overwhelming the grid, with a bounded buffer, a configurable row cap, and a hint banner you can dismiss when you already know the feature.
- **`bytea` display modes**: `bytea` values now show up the way you expect, whether you prefer `hex0x`, PostgreSQL `\x` text, or a JSON-friendly debug shape.
- **SQL Assistant turn controls**: You can regenerate the latest reply without repeating yourself, branch from an earlier turn, or prefill the composer when you want to move faster.
- **Result grid toolbar & editing workflow**: The result grid now feels steadier to work in, with a clearer toolbar, better banners, and a final commit check before edits are written back.

### Changed
- **Export vs Auto-LIMIT**: Exports now rerun the original SQL instead of the display-limited query, so CSV/JSON/Excel downloads can include everything you asked for.
- **Renderer & executor integration**: Windowed fetches and edit commits are coordinated in the extension host so the UI stays aligned with what the database is actually doing.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **SQL Assistant editor tabs**: You can open SQL Assistant in the main editor now, which makes the flow feel less cramped when the sidebar is not enough.
- **Multi-tab SQL Assistant workflow**: Multiple assistant tabs are supported, so you can keep separate conversations going without losing your place.
- **AI Insights dashboard panel**: The dashboard now surfaces schema health, connection analytics, vacuum progress, and direct Ask AI actions in one place.

### Fixed
- **SQL completion deduplication**: Table and column suggestions are deduplicated before caching, so notebook autocomplete stops repeating itself.
- **Assistant routing consistency**: Chat attachments and assistant updates now follow the active SQL Assistant webview, which keeps multi-tab conversations in sync.
- **Review changes UI stability**: The result review / compare UI now renders more consistently and keeps actions aligned with the active table state.

### Changed
- **Dashboard telemetry expansion**: Dashboard stats now show unused indexes, sequential scans, table bloat, autovacuum progress, tables needing vacuum, and connections grouped by application name.
- **Dashboard AI interactions**: You can launch AI prompts from the dashboard, run queries for analysis, download CSV from AI-assisted results, and get notified when health starts slipping.

### Added
- **Anthropic model discovery**: AI Settings now pulls Anthropic models from the official `/v1/models` API, so the list stays in sync without manual upkeep.
- **Guided chat responses**: Assistant replies can now offer numbered follow-ups, optional next-step bubbles, and the occasional well-placed factoid or joke when it actually helps.

### Changed
- **AI key lookup**: Direct AI provider keys now resolve from `SecretStorage` first, which prevents the frustrating false "API key required" message when the key is already saved.
- **Chat identity and styling**: Assistant messages are labeled **PG Studio Bot**, with clearer contrast and quote styling that makes replies easier to read.
- **Composer UX**: The chat input and suggestion bubbles were tightened for readability and kept from carrying stale next-step actions between chats.

### Fixed
- **Follow-up selection**: Typing a number now picks the matching follow-up question from the previous assistant message instead of starting over.
- **Next-step carry-over**: Next-step bubbles now stay tied to the active conversation, so they do not leak into the next chat.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-03-21
